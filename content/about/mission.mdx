# Strengthening Democracy Through Observation

**Monitoring civic space, protecting election observers across Africa**
</HeroSection>

## Our Mission

AfEONet's mission is to monitor and document the state of civic space for citizen election observers in Africa. Our ultimate goal is to establish a robust monitoring framework that highlights and reports whenever the work of citizen observers is threatened.

Citizen election observers are now recognized as human rights defenders, playing an indispensable role in upholding civil and political rights, as well as strengthening democratic values and principles.
