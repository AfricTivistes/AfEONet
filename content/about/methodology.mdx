# Our Methodology

AfEONet uses a rigorous methodology to assess the state of civic space for election observers. Our approach combines qualitative and quantitative data collection to provide a comprehensive picture of the situation.

## Color Coding System

We use a color coding system to visually represent the different civic space situations:

<StatusGrid>

<StatusCard status="open">
**Open/free/secure**
</StatusCard>

<StatusCard status="narrowed">
**Narrowed**
</StatusCard>

<StatusCard status="obstructed">
**Obstructed**
</StatusCard>

<StatusCard status="repressed">
**Repressed/threatened**
</StatusCard>

<StatusCard status="closed">
**Closed**
</StatusCard>

</StatusGrid>

## Data Collection Process

Our data collection process involves a network of focal persons in different African countries. These individuals are trained to observe and document the state of civic space according to our eight dimensions. The collected data is then validated by our team of administrators before being published on the platform.
