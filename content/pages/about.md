## Our Mission

AfEONet's mission is to monitor and document the state of civic space for citizen election observers in Africa. Our ultimate goal is to establish a robust monitoring framework that highlights and reports whenever the work of citizen observers is threatened.

Citizen election observers are now recognized as human rights defenders, playing an indispensable role in upholding civil and political rights, as well as strengthening democratic values and principles.

## Strengthening Democracy Through Observation

At AfEONet, we believe that strong democratic institutions require active civic participation and robust oversight mechanisms.

## The 8 Dimensions of Civic Space

Our monitoring framework focuses on eight key dimensions that define civic space for election observers:

### 1. Regulatory Framework

The regulatory framework that protects citizen observers as human rights defenders, including laws and institutions governing civil society organizations' operations.

### 2. Administrative Constraints

Accreditation procedures and other bureaucracies imposed on citizen observers, which were once relatively simple but have become more constraining.

### 3. Relationship with Electoral Management Body

The quality and nature of the relationship between citizen observer organizations and the electoral management body.

### 4. Security and Well-being

The use of legal and illegal mechanisms that threaten the work of citizen observer organizations, their leaders, staff, and volunteers.

### 5. Access to Electoral Data

The procedures in place to allow citizen observers to access information on electoral management and processes.

### 6. Access to Funding

The freedom of citizen observers to mobilize funding for election observation, the types of funding sources available, and whether these sources are open or controlled.

### 7. Dialogue and Consultation

The platforms available for citizen observers to engage in dialogue with relevant government institutions, including the electoral management body, on observation recommendations and electoral reforms.

### 8. Perception of Observers

The perception of the ruling party/regime, opposition political parties, media, and the general public on the role of citizen observers in democracy and the credibility of elections.

## Our Methodology

AfEONet uses a rigorous methodology to assess the state of civic space for election observers. Our approach combines qualitative and quantitative data collection to provide a comprehensive picture of the situation.

### Color Coding System

We use a color coding system to visually represent the different civic space situations:

- **Open/free/secure** - Green
- **Narrowed** - Yellow  
- **Obstructed** - Orange
- **Repressed/threatened** - Red
- **Closed** - Dark Red

### Data Collection Process

Our data collection process involves a network of focal persons in different African countries. These individuals are trained to observe and document the state of civic space according to our eight dimensions. The collected data is then validated by our team of administrators before being published on the platform.

## Our Partners
